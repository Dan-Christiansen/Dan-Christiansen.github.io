## Link 0 Commands

[Link 0 Commands](https://gaussian.com/link0/)

These control how the computer will run the simulation (e.g., number of processors, dynamic memory to use, checkpoints). All `Link 0 Commands` go at the top of the input file before any `Route` commands.

### Set the number of processors to run on
`%nprocs=N`, where `N` is the desired number of processors to use. If this is not set in the header, it will default to a value of `1` and only run on one processor.

### Declare the memory to use
`%mem=N` Sets the dynamic memory used in 8-byte words. This value is followed by 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', or 'TB' to indicate kil-, mega-, giga-, and tera-bytes or words. Default value is 800MB

Ex. `%mem=8GB` will have 8 GB of dynamic memory assigned

### Setup a checkpoint file
This is particularly useful if you are performing simulations in series (e.g., structure optimization followed by partial charge calculation)

`%chk=filename.chk` This will produce a checkpoint file at the end of the first simulation and can be used as the input to a following simulation

## Route Commands
These define the kind of calculation to be performed. They follow the _Link 0 Commands_ section, with no preceding empty lines

## Multi-step simulations
To perform multiple steps (e.g., structure optimization before electronic structure calculation), you must use a `Link` between the commands for each simulation

## Sample file for structure optimization and electronic structure calculation
The following code will perform structure optimization and then partial charge calculation for the molecule. It is commanded to use 4 processors and produce checkpoints after each calculation. The first step is structural optimization using the B3LYP-31G(d,p) basis set. The output of this will be fed into the partial charge calculation step which uses the same basis set, but now with the CHELP scheme used to report atomic partial charges.
