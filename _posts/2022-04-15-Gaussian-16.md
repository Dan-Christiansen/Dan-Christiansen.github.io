## Link 0 Commands

[Link 0 Commands](https://gaussian.com/link0/)

These control how the computer will run the simulation (e.g., number of processors, dynamic memory to use, checkpoints). All `Link 0 Commands` go at the top of the input file before any `Route` commands.

### Set the number of processors to run on
`%nprocs=N`, where `N` is the desired number of processors to use. If this is not set in the header, it will default to a value of `1` and only run on one processor.

### Declare the memory to use
`%mem=N` Sets the dynamic memory used in 8-byte words. This value is followed by 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', or 'TB' to indicate kil-, mega-, giga-, and tera-bytes or words. Default value is 800MB

Ex. `%mem=8GB` will have 8 GB of dynamic memory assinged

### Setup a checkpoint file
This is particularly useful if you are performing simulations in series (e.g., structure optimization followed by partial charge calculation)

`%chk=filename.chk` This will produce a checkpoint file at the end of the first simulation and can be used as the input to a following simulation.
