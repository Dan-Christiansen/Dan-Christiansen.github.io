## Link 0 Commands

## Set the number of processors to run on
Include `%nprocs=N` in the _Link 0 Commands_ section at the head of the input file, where `N` is the desired number of processors. If this is not set in the header, it will default to a value of `1` and only run on one processor.

## Declare the RAM to use
