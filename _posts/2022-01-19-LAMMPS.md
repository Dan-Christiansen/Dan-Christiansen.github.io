Notes while learning to use LAMMPS molecular dynamics code

[LAMMPS Documentation Page](https://docs.lammps.org/)

## Install LAMMPS

### Windows
Use a [pre-compiled Windows installer](https://rpm.lammps.org/windows/)

### Ubuntu Linux
In terminal, execute:
```
$ sudo apt-get install lammps-stable
```

## Running LAMMPS
LAMMPS simulation input files are text files named `in.filename`

Run simulations in command line (terminal, shell, console) with
```
lmp -in in.filename

lmp < in.filename
```

`-in` is necessary when running in parallel with mpirun

## Input files
The `in.filename` LAMMPS input file describes the system parameters, physics, logging, etc.

It is read line-by-line as it executes and will stop when an error occurs or the last line is reached. Thus, order of commands is important

Comments in the input file are made by placing a `#` before the text to be commented.

## Sample LAMMPS simulation
[Sample LAMMPS simulation input file](https://www.lammps.org/inputs/in.logo.txt)

Download the text file and move it to a working directory. Within this directory, run `lmp -in in.logo.txt`

This simulation produces two output files, `log.lammps`, the simulation log, and `tmp.dump`, the trajectory file

## Most useful simulation commands
<!--#`units` - -->

## Variables

## External force fields
