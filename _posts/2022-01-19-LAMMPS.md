Notes while learning to use LAMMPS molecular dynamics code

[LAMMPS Documentation Page](https://docs.lammps.org/)

## Install LAMMPS

### Windows
Use a [pre-compiled Windows installer](https://rpm.lammps.org/windows/)

### Ubuntu Linux
In terminal, execute:
```
$ sudo apt-get install lammps-stable
```

## Running LAMMPS
LAMMPS simulation input files are text files named `in.filename`

Run simulations in command line (terminal, shell, console) with
```
lmp -in in.filename

lmp < in.filename
```

`-in` is necessary when running in parallel with mpirun

## Input files
The `in.filename` LAMMPS input file describes the system parameters, physics, logging, etc.

It is read line-by-line as it executes and will stop when an error occurs or the last line is reached. Thus, order of commands is important

Comments in the input file are made by placing a `#` before the text to be commented.

## Sample LAMMPS simulation
[Sample LAMMPS simulation input file](https://www.lammps.org/inputs/in.logo.txt)

Download the text file and move it to a working directory. Using a terminal within this directory, execute `lmp -in in.logo.txt`

This simulation produces two output files, `log.lammps`, the simulation log, and `tmp.dump`, the trajectory file

## Most useful simulation commands
* `[units](https://docs.lammps.org/units.html)` - Select the system of units to use for simulation parameters
* `[dump](https://docs.lammps.org/dump.html)` - Define method and selection of output data to print out in the `dump`
* `[read_data](https://docs.lammps.org/read_data.html)` - Read data file

## Force fields
[LAMMPS Force Fields documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/2001/force_fields.html)

## LAMMPS Data Format
[LAMMPS Data File Format](https://docs.lammps.org/2001/data_format.html#_cch3_930958962)

[Sample Data File with Annotations](https://docs.lammps.org/2001/data_format.html#_cch3_930958969)

A `Data File` describes the system to be simulated, including system properties, atom and molecular topologies, atom coordinates. These files must be called by the `read` command within a LAMMPS script.

First line is file description, next line is skipped. Every line after is read (unless commented with a #)

 Data files consist of a mandatory three sections, `header`, `Masses`, and `Atoms`. If necessary, additional sections must be included: `Bonds`, `Angles`, `Dihedrals`, and `Impropers`

The `header` section is placed at the top of the file, outlining the number of atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, types of atoms/bonds/angles/dihedrals, and simulation box dimensions
```
LAMMPS Description           (1st line of file)

100 atoms         (this must be the 3rd line, 1st 2 lines are ignored)
95 bonds                (# of bonds to be simulated)
50 angles               (include these lines even if number = 0)
30 dihedrals
20 impropers

5 atom types           (# of nonbond atom types)
10 bond types          (# of bond types = sets of bond coefficients)
18 angle types         
20 dihedral types      (do not include a bond,angle,dihedral,improper type
2 improper types             line if number of bonds,angles,etc is 0)

-0.5 0.5 xlo xhi       (for periodic systems this is box size,
-0.5 0.5 ylo yhi        for non-periodic it is min/max extent of atoms)
-0.5 0.5 zlo zhi       (do not include this line for 2-d simulations)
```

Following is an empty line then the `Masses` of each atom type
```
Masses

  1 mass
  ...
  N mass                           (N = # of atom types)
```

 then the `Atoms` section. The structure of each line of the `Atoms` section is
 ```
 Atoms

   1 molecule-tag atom-type q x y z nx ny nz  (nx,ny,nz are optional -
   ...                                    see "true flag" input command)
   ...                
   N molecule-tag atom-type q x y z nx ny nz  (N = # of atoms)
```

See the documentation for explanations and examples of all remaining sections

## Polymer simulation in lammps
[MS State Polymer simulation tutorial](https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/LAMMPS_Polymer.html)

The above tutorial simulates a linear polymer chain constructed from 100 bonded atoms. The initial configuration file `PE_cl100.txt` was prepared in MATLAB. [Download PE_cl100.txt here](https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/images/e/e1/PE_cl100.txt)

LAMMPS simulation script `in.deform.polychain.txt` will perform the simulations defined in [Hossain, Tschopp, et al. 2010, Polymer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032386110008839). This script performs equilibration and minimization of the system

Outputs are `log.lammps`, `log.PE_cl100`, and a number of `dump.com_#.cfg` files. These describe how the simulation was ran, what its results were, and frames to visualize, correspondingly

The tutorial instructs to download several software to clean and visualize the dump files, but I found it easier to comment the included `dump` command and write my own
```
dump		1 all atom 6 ${simname}.lammpstrj
```
This way it will produce a single output file that can be readily opened in [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), my visualizer of choice
