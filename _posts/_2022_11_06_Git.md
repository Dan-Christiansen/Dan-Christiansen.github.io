Notes and references on using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

The following takes influence from [Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides), [Atlassian BitBucket Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials), [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), and especially the [GitHub Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

## About Git
Git is a free, open-source distributed version control system best suited for collaborative, fast-pace projects. The distributed nature of the software ensures all collaborators have the full history of a repository, guaranteeing backups and enabling branching for rapid development, debugging, and convenient code review. Additionally, Git comes with SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) hashing schemes for change storage, accelerating operations.

Git can be installed as a command line and GUI version (instructions below), but it is also already built-in to [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (a multi-function GUI for working with Git). So, no matter how you would like to use Git, you can find something you are comfortable with.

## Installing Git
This section will detail local installation of Git, which is compatible for operations on local (same machine) or remote (other machine, Azure, AWS). I will not be describing working with Azure, AWS, or any other remote system here. Further, GitHub Desktop and others will already have Git functionality in-built, so the following steps may not be necessary and relevant software documentation should be referenced.

As you work through the installer, I would suggest leaving the default parameters, unless you know what each change could be for (which likely means you don't need to be reading this, but thanks for spending time on my site!).

For further instruction on installing Git, check out the [Official Git Downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/) or [Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

### Windows
To install Git on Windows, first download the relevant installer from the [Official Git Downloads Windows page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and run the Git Setup executable. This will install Git Bash (if selected in the setup wizard) and the Git GUI.

### macOS
Git comes pre-installed in most versions of macOS, but if an installer is preferred or an update is required, check out the [Official Git Downloads macOS page](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for several methods to install Git.

### Linux
Git comes with many of the Linux operating systems and there are a few ways to install or update Git. Some of these are outlined in the [Official Git Downloads Linux and Unix page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux). It is possible to install a local
