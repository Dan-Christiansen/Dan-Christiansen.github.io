## Background
Lowest level of the hierarchical machine learning (ML) approach to predicting ionic conductivity of zwitterionic hydrogels

Simulate hydration and ion association to zwitterions in aqueous conditions

Calculate cheminformatic descriptors to bolster dataset and enhance ML model accuracy

Train ML algorithms on this dataset

Use this dataset and high-accuracy ML models as foundation for training improved ML model accuracy at greater scale (single- and multi-polymer)

## Methods
Table of zwitterion chemistries

Simulation parameters

Simulations performed in GROMACS molecular dynamics software

Link to simulation parameters

## Analysis
Method to calculate the radial distribution function (RDF), $g(r)$

Method to calculate the coordination number, $N$

Savitzky-Golay filter method to rapidly find the radii of the first peak and following valley of the RDF plot

Categorical values in dataset:
* anionic moiety
* cationic moiety
* carbon-spacer chemistry
