Notes on GROMACS molecular dynamics code

[GROMACS Documentation Page](https://manual.gromacs.org/)

## Beginner tutorials
Justin A. Lemkul, Ph.D., has produced a repository of beginner tutorials for GROMACS which can be accessed through [mdtutorials.com/gmx/](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/jalemkul/gmx_tutorials_livecoms), with an [open-access article](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e5068) explaining each tutorial in more depth

Dr. Lemkul describes the tutorials as
> 1. Lysozyme in Water: The intent of this tutorial is to give new users a basic introduction into the tools used to prepare, run, and perform simple analysis on a "typical" system with GROMACS.
> 2. KALP15 in DPPC: This tutorial is more advanced, and is designed for more experienced users who want to simulate membrane proteins and understand force field structure and modification.
> 3. Umbrella Sampling: Also somewhat advanced, this tutorial is intended for users who wish to learn to use umbrella sampling to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) along a single, linear degree of freedom.
> 4. Biphasic Systems: The construction of a biphasic cyclohexane-water system.
> 5. Protein-Ligand Complex: The fifth tutorial instructs the user on how to deal with a protein-ligand system, with a focus on proper ligand parametrization and topology handling.
> 6. Free Energy of Solvation: This tutorial describes the procedure for carrying out a simple free energy calculation, the elimination of van der Waals interactions between a simple molecule (methane) and water. More complicated systems are discussed.
> 7. Virtual Sites: This tutorial guides the user through manual construction of virtual sites for a very simple linear, triatomic molecule (CO2).

## Topology `.top` and `.itp` files
[Documentation](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/reference-manual/topologies/topology-file-formats.html)

The topology file includes the parameters defining the system, the content within the system, and additional restraints, descriptions, etc. which a user may wish to include. Molecular topologies are written in a `.top` file or can be referenced by an `.itp` within the `.top`

There is considerable nuance in how these files are made, so consult the documentation and read the error messages carefully

## Structure files
[Documentation](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1/user-guide/file-formats.html#gro)

Gist of the file, top to bottom:
> Simulation title - String
> Number of atoms - Integer
> One line per atom in format: "%5d%-5s%5s%5d%8.3f%8.3f%8.3f%8.4f%8.4f%8.4f"
> Box dimensions - Floats describing X, Y, and Z box dimensions, separated by spaces

From left to right, the format to describe each atom is (exactly quoting from the documentation)
> residue number (5 positions, integer)
> residue name (5 characters)
> atom name (5 characters)
> atom number (5 positions, integer)
> position (in nm, x y z in 3 columns, each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)
> velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s), x y z in 3 columns, each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)

## OPLS force field
The [Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS)](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/oplsaam.html) is a set of parameters for describing proteins and organic molecules

Within the GROMACS installation, there is a folder `oplsaa.ff`, located at `/share/gromacs/top/oplsaa.ff`, which contains several useful files for simulations
* spc, spce, tip3p, tip4pew, tip4p, tip5pe, tip5p `.itp` files - Several water models that can be used for solvating systems. Read more about these within the `watermodels.dat` file or in the GROMACS documentation
* ions.itp - Topology of common ions (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>)
* Organic solvent topology files - 1propanol.itp, ethanol.itp, methanol.itp
<!--* ffbonded.itp -
* ffnonbonded.itp -
* atomname2type.n2t -
* -->
* forcefield.doc - Citation for using the OPLS-AA topology files

## Adding custom topologies to `aminoacids.rtp`

## United-Atom (UA) vs. All-Atom (AA) simulation
Molecular topologies can described using all-atom (AA), united-atom (UA), or a combination of the two. All-atom topologies describe _every_ atom individually (including hydrogens). United-atom will collapse the structural and chemical descriptions of some combination of atoms into a single point, typically near the original center of mass of the grouping

The OPLS force field makes working between AA, UA, and mixed fairly simple. All that is necessary to produce a UA topology for a functional group is to find the OPLS index in the `oplsaa.ff` folder

## LigParGen topology generator
[LigParGen](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/) is used to produce OPLS force field parameters for organic molecules (proteins, polymers, etc.)

The software may be used [in a browser](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/) or by [command-line on a local LigParGen server](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-install-ligpargen-server-locally-leela-sriram-dodda/)

## Polymer simulation
