**All instructions written for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04**

## Download Ubuntu iso
[Install Ubuntu tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

[Ubuntu images](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

## Activate superuser permissions
**Activating superuser permissions in Ubuntu will require root privileges on the account being accessed from, or access to the root password**

Open a terminal with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T`. Enter `sudo -i` or `sudo -s` and enter your password (or the root password if missing root privileges)

## Mount a hard drive
**This requires root permissions**

Create a folder to mount the drive to
`sudo mkdir /mnt/hdd1`

Open fstab with nano/vim with sudo active
`sudo nano /etc/fstab`

Add the following to the end of the file:
`/dev/drive-partition-name    /mnt/hdd1    ext4    defaults    0    0`
Save and close the file.

Mount the drive
`sudo mount /dev/drive-partition-name /mnt/hdd1`

## Backup between local hard drives using `cron` and `rsync`
### `rsync` to backup files between local hard drives
[Tutorial for Rsync](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories)

Execute `rsync` in terminal with archive mode active (recommended)
`rsync -a from_dir to_dir`

[Useful `rsync` options](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)
```
-r, --recursive		recurse into directories
-v, --verbose		increase verbosity
-q, --quiet		suppress non-error messages
-a, --archive		archive mode
-u, --update		skip files that are newer on the receiver
-d, --dirs		transfer directories without recursing
-n, --dry-run		perform a trial run with no changes mode
```

### `rsync` to backup files between remote hard drives
Syncing a local file or directory to a remote destination

`rsync -a /path/to/local/dir username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/destination`

Syncing a remote file or directory to a local destination

`rsync -a username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/dir /path/to/local/destination`

### `cron` scheduling
[Tutorial on using `cron` in Linux](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux)

The `cron` utility can be used to schedule command execution. This is particularly useful for scheduling backups with `rsync`, which is the principal use here

#### `cron` runs in `/etc/cron.d`
Individual `cron` runs can be made within `/etc/cron.d/`. These files can execute SHELL commands

#### `cron` runs in `crontab`
`crontab` is a user-specific table of `cron` runs to be executed. Access `crontab` with `crontab -e` command in terminal. A prompt will appear asking for an editor. Select whichever number corresponds to `/bin/nano` and the `crontab` will appear. It will have instructions for adding a scheduled `cron` run to the end of the file. This is the most practical way to make a `cron` run

A useful outline of a job definition by [David Both](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux) is
```
# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed
```

If no user-name is provided, then the `cron` run is executed as the user who the `crontab` file (/var/spool/cron/crontabs) belongs to

There are many other utilities which can make `cron` more useful, for example emailing the user when the command is executed with `MAILTO`

#### View all users `crontabs` on a computer
In a terminal, access all users `crontabs` in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`. Each users `crontab` will be a single file accessible with `nano`, `vim`, etc.

Ex. If my username were `dc`, my `crontabs` could be read with `nano /var/spool/cron/crontabs/dc`

## Select a block of text in `nano`
While the cursor is at the line of the section to be selected, press `Alt`+`A`, then move the cursor with the arrow keys to select the desired block of text

## Indent or unindent multiple lines of text in `nano`
### Indent
`Alt`+`Shift`+`]` (also written `Alt`+`}`)

### Unindent
`Alt`+`Shift`+`[` (also written `Alt`+`{`)
