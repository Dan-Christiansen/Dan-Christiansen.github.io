1. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least half an hour. During this time, preheat oven to 350&deg;F with racks in the middle of the oven
1. Line baking tray(s) with parchment paper. Scoop &frac14; cup dough into balls and place at least 2-3" from neighbors on tray
1. Place tray(s) in oven. Bake for 6 minutes, rotate trays 180&deg;, then bake another 6 minutes
1. After the second interval, check the color of the cookies. They should be golden and a deeper brown on the edges. They may need another 1-3 minutes
