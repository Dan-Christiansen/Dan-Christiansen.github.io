This place will be used to store my personal projects and writing on things I am interested in.

I am an R&D Data Scientist with Dow Chemical's Polyurethane business developing the Predictive Intelligence capability.

Previously, I completed my doctoral degree in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago with my thesis "Zwitterion Hydration and Ion Association Design Principles Elucidated by Simulation and Machine Learning". In this work, I studied structure-property relationships of zwitterions using molecular simulations, cheminformatics, and data science techniques.

While not studying or working, I enjoy trying new coffee shops, visiting art galleries, and running.
