Hello!

I am Dan Christiansen, a chemical engineering graduate student, programmer, and coffee hunter! I will be using this website to store my personal projects and writing on things I am interested in.

I currently study at the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Chemical Engineering in the <a href="https://tranzabi.people.uic.edu" target="_blank">Molecular Simulations Laboratory</a>.
