This place will be used to store my personal projects and writing on things I am interested in.

I am currently a doctoral candidate in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the [Molecular Simulations Laboratory](https://tranzabi.people.uic.edu).

While not studying or working, I enjoy exploring the city for coffee spots, camping and hiking in the various midwest natures, and paddling my foldable kayak.
