Education
======
* Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Chemical Engineering, Tulane University, New Orleans, 2018
* Doctorate of Philosophy Candidate in Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======
* **Graduate Research Scientist (2018-Present)** - University of Illinois at Chicago, Supervised by Shafigh Mehraeen, PhD, and Gang Cheng, PhD
  * Conducted dissertation research on ionic conductivity, antifouling, and mechanical strength of zwitterionic polymers using computational simulations and artificial intelligence techniques for material design and property prediction
  * Received the Graduate Student Research Award from the University of Illinois at Chicago
  * Mentored several undergaduate students as part of UIC Guaranteed Paid Internship Program

* **Graduate Intern (Summer 2021)** - Dow Chemical Data Science Internship, Supervised by Fabio Aguirre, Will Koonce
  * Developed theory-based models and identified cheminformatic descriptors for input to predictive intelligence models, resulting in improved accuracy for all models
  * Created a uniform data structure for chemical identification and programmed descriptor calculations using open-source software which may be included in existing architectures
  * Worked with co-interns to schedule, organize, and present monthly progress updates for corporate sponsors

* **Undergraduate Research Assistant (Spring 2016-Spring 2018)** - Tulane University Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department, Supervised by Julie N. L. Albert, PhD
  * Performed raster solvent vapor annealing on semicrystalline homopolymer thick films to induce change in optical and mechanical properties

* **Undergraduate Research Assistant (Summer 2017)** - SMART REU, Louisiana State University Department of Chemistry, Supervised by John A. Pojman, PhD
  * Designed experimental methods, material synthesis and characterization techniques for the design of fast-curing polyethers
  * Found a novel epoxy resin which was UV and thermally set-on-demand, curing in seconds

* **Undergraduate Intern (Summer 2016)** - Summer Undergraduate Laboratory Internship, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Biology and Climate Science Department, Supervised by John Heiser
  * Designed a low-cost, microcontrolled datalogger for deployment with a large-area dispersed solar sensor array
    * Responsible for programming, circuit design, testing and validation, and product durability testing
    * Final design evaluated to be 97% accurate compared to research-grade, while only 3% of the cost
  * Project report submitted to the US Congress and work presented for the Biology and Climate Science Department summer seminar
