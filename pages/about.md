Hello!

I am Dan Christiansen, a chemical engineering graduate student, programmer, and coffee hunter! I will be using this website to store my personal projects and writing on things I am interested in.

I currently study at the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Chemical Engineering in the [Molecular Simulations Laboratory](https://tranzabi.people.uic.edu).
