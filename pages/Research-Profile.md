PhD Candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago studying artificial intelligence and polymeric material design under Shafigh Mehraeen and Gang Cheng. I perform multiscale computational simulations of polymers with the intent of understanding how molecular features influence macroscopic properties. This understanding enables me to best design artificial intelligence tools for accelerated next-generation material design.
